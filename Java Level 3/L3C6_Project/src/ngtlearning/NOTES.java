	 * This, Super, Interface, and Polymorphism:::
	 * "this" reference always points to an object's own instance
	 * -any can use this reference to refer to its own instance
	 * "super" refers to the parent or super class of a class
	 * interface can define only abstract methods and constants (like an abstract class w/ all the abstract methods)
	 * -a class can implement multiple interfaces
	 * -keyword "implements" to implement an interface
	 * -the class which implements an interface must implements all the methods of the interface
	 * polymorphism means tacking more than one form
	 * -characteristic of being able to assign a dif. behavior to a method in a subclass
	 * -if you call a method, based on the object and you'll get different results
	 * -2 types: runtime(dynamic) and compile time(statistic)
	 * 	-runtime polymorphism aka method overriding
	 * 	-compile time polymorphism is the method overloading
